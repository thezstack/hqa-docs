# Arabic
In order to fully understand the depth of the Quran, we teach our students the arabic language. In each grade level students are divided into 3 groups based on the placement exam taken at the beginning of the year. Beginners, intermediate and advanced levels are available. This division allows your child to learn arabic at his or her comfortable pace along with classmates at their level. The student to teacher ratio is much lower than a general classroom, this empowers your child to have direct communication with their teacher.

## Elementary
Student focus  on  vocabulary  and  communication. Students  learn  basic  grammar  points,  the  alphabet,  numbers,  and  other
basic vocabulary concepts. The curriculum focuses on pronunciation and having a basic conversation.

## Middle school

Students  begin  their  study  of  Arabic  by  reviewing  the  alphabet,  rules  of  pronunciation,
greetings and simple conversations, ordering in a restaurant and other customs before moving on to more complicated grammar. The curriculum enhances student vocabulary,
listening comprehension skills, and verbal communication.

## High School
