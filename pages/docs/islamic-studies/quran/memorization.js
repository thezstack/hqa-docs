## Quran Kareem Memorization Curriculum
At HQA, we bring the best comprehensive memorization program that is not limited to just mere and blind memorization; our program is much deeper than that.  It plays an integral part in the preparation of our students to be the future scholars and leaders of Islam in this country.


## Tafseer
We start with a deep understanding of the Quran. Our philisophy is to answer the why first. This builds a strong foundation of past wisdom, values, and knowledge of the world.  Each student is tested daily on the meaning of what he or she is going to memorize first before being tested on memorization. This step also strengthens and enhances the process of memorization.
Once the student finishes understanding the meaning of the Surah and memorizing it, he or she is required to look deeply into the Surah and analyze it to find out the main lessons that the Surah is teaching.

 ### Answering the Why - Surat Ashams
  "As Clear as the Sun". Analyzing the Surah shows that it has the Qasam, the Answer to the Qasam, and an example. The Qasam is by the sun and the other things Allah swears by in the Surah. The answer to this Qasam is the verse that says قد أفلح من زكاها وقد خاب من دساها, which means successful indeed is the one who elevates himself or herself and unsuccessful indeed is the one who does not. The rest of the Surah is an example about Thamoud and how they failed to do so. Once the student does this analysis to find the lesson or lessons of the Surah, he or she is asked about how he or she would implement these lessons in his or her personal life, which is the practice of the lessons of the Surah. This in turn will affect positively the personality of the child A strong emphasis is placed on the correct pronunciation of each letter and each word of the Quran, i.e., on phonics (مخارج الحروف). A good number of Muslims who read and memorize the Holy Quran have words and verses pronounced incorrectly because they were not corrected the first time they learned it; and in some cases, they inherited the problem from their teachers.
