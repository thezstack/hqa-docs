## Elementary Curriculum

Houston Quran Academy is where children can explore the world around them. We stimulate their minds and nurture their hearts. We strongly believe that a child learns best when in a safe, secure, and happy environment.
Our mission is to engage students in hands-on learning initiated by their own curiosity. Therefore, our curriculum revolves around project-based learning. Lessons, assignments, and assessments are designed for and adjusted to each child’s level and needs.

In kindergarten through 2nd grade, your child establishes a firm foundation in  mathematics, science, literacy, and social studies. In addition to these core subjects, technology, programming, arabic, and physical education all enhance your child’s learning experience.

Each child is individually supported in Houston Quran Academy's learning community with relationships and resources that foster confidence, problem solving, creativity and a passion for learning.

In Grades 3 to 5, your child receives instruction that provides the best preparation for their continued learning and growth.

The curriculum at HQA covers all Texas requirements STAAR TEKS and National Standards. HQA even uses IOWA evaluation for even further


The following teaching areas are important components of our elementary school curriculum:



## Mathematics
Our Mathematics program focuses on problem solving and the development of higher-order critical thinking skills, through real world application. Our curriculum presents mathematics in a logical progression designed to reduce learning gaps, develop persistence in problem solving, and prepare students to understand advanced mathematical concepts.

## Science
The Science program is based around hands-on study of Quranic, Earth, and Life sciences. Students engage in the scientific process of questioning and reasoning behind why the world works while referencing back to the Holy Quran. The science program supports a variety of hands-on labs and study topics.

## Literacy
Our English Language Arts program focus on core fundamentals like reading, writing, speaking, & listening. Phonics training begins in kindergarten and expands during each academic year, with an emphasis on building vocabulary, reading comprehension, analysis, and other higher-order thinking skills. In grades 3rd to 5th, reading comprehension and literary analysis are emphasized using poetry, short stories, fiction, and nonfiction.


## Social Studies
Social Studies introduces children to history, geography, and map making skills . Much of the focus in social studies is on hands-on activities and projects, films, video and field trips. Geography and mapping skills are integrated with the aim of helping students understand themselves and the world before them.

## Technology
The technology program develops a sense of computer literacy in each student. Students perform various computer operations, experience new technologies, and learn to use that knowledge in a responsible and independent manner.
