# Clubs



## Robotics
We are a club that is excited to build physical things to expand the curiosity of children with engineering and technology. Students learn  engineering concepts involving motors, pulleys and  different combinations of gears
types of gears and how they work together. Fundametal programming concepts which help prepare young minds for developing software.
## Baking
We are a club that provides a place for students who enjoy baking to bake in school. Members of this club will be making new and different desserts and, of course, enjoying them, sharing them, donating them, or selling them to donate profits to an organization chosen by the club members.
Recipes are fun, challenging, & tasty!
## Tarbiya
Tarbiyah is most important with respect to our children, so that they are brought up upon the correct path of Islam. On an individual level, it helps us to dedicate some time to research a topic in the deen, and motivate ourselves to practice what we preach. By teaching it to others, we are not just helping ourselves to grow, but sharing it with our wider community, and hopefully it will be a continuous good deed. It should be a nurturing ground for educational, spiritual, and intellectual development. This is only a drop in the ocean of self-development, but we should nonetheless use this as a resource to implement in our lives, as that is the purpose of knowledge- to do something with it.
