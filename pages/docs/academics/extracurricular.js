We are a club focused on intellectual discussions of different topics of deen. We enjoy dissecting the quran and understanding the depth of the arabic language and major themes. We dedicate some time to research a topic in the deen, and motivate ourselves to practice what we preach. By teaching it to others, we are not just helping ourselves to grow, but sharing it with our wider community.
